### Dabuntu
EventShop is used for Personalized Situation Detection and Control by combining heterogeneous web streams. Data streams generated by social media, sensor networks, internet of things, and digitalization of transactions provide us with abundance of data which when analysed will provide us with valuable data which can be used to detect patterns to notify when a particular situation occurs.

### About Us

### Data Ingestion Layer
Data available in the Internet is of different formats and it has to be unified to a common format. The solution provided is to convert it into STT (Space Time Theme, STT) format. 
The data is then converted to a two dimensional grid called the Emage.
Any CSV, Json, Xml or twitter data source can now be converted to a STT format using eventshop.
Once the data sources are created, different spatio-temporal like min, max, average, sum, majority, split uniform, linear_interpolation. 

### Rule Engine
The rules engine is used to query the data stored by the data source. The rules engine is a mongo specific implementation but can be changed for any other kind of Database.

The idea of the rule engine is to query the data stored in the DB. The fields required as an output should be specified in the Extract Field.
Select the field in which you want to query and select the query operator and specify the parameters as a comma separated value.
The query operators populated depend on the data type specified in the data syntax when configuring the Data source.

### Query Processing Framework
A Query Plan tree is constructed to perform the different operations on the emage generated. The query tree is parsed to check if it can be executed in an asynchronous manner and events are generated to perform each query operation. 

### Alert Framework
Alert Framework is used to set up notify any abnormal conditions in the raw data or transformed data. Alerts can be created either on Query or Data Source and can be also be created to provide any solution if any.

### DB setup

Run the sql files in 

https://github.com/dabuntu/es/blob/master/EventshopJava/src/main/resources/Sql/Eventshop/eventshop.sql

and the sql files in the following folder in the same order

https://github.com/dabuntu/es/tree/master/EventshopJava/src/main/resources/Sql

### Wiki

The installation setup and a detailed description is available in the Wiki

https://github.com/dabuntu/es/wiki

##Steps:
1.create a database called dbeventshop in mysql
create database dbeventshop;
2.Apply db SQL script.
sudo mysql -uroot -proot dbeventshop < dbeventshop.sql
This sql file is a part of code set.
The following steps from Step3 until Step 6 can be seen from the last 2 videos "Setting up Eventshop on local" on https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2sIMyXzRPMIwUwXGwWdB5IiGMJITvn4-
3.Download the code from repository.
4.Import the project as maven project.
5.Download maven dependencies.
6.Build the project.
7.Start Zookeeper Server on port 2181 ( default port, can be changed) .
8. Start Kafka Server on port 9092 ( default port, can be changed).
See here:http://kafka.apache.org/07/quickstart.html
(Only until Step 2).
9. Run the jetty server and observe the console 
10. Type this url on your browser:
Assuming localhost's port number is 8085
localhost:8085/eventshoplinux/
